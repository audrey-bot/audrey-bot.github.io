            <h2>Welcome to the world of The Dark lane</h2>
            <br>
           <p> The Dark lane is the first official collection of <a href="https://audreyvuca.net"> AudreyV.u.c.a </a> consisting of 4 characters residing in or somehow being connected to
        The Dark lane. It centers around Luanne, a quiet and introspective girl who is tackling imagination vs reality. Coping with uncertainty and ambiguity, Luanne spends her time 
        inching towards the truth in an attempt to piece together what she knows. She has obsessive qualities, especially when it comes to watching tv and the Uglies. Explore her room
        and check out some of her creations in the heart of the The Dark lane. 
    <br> 
        P.S - locate someone wearing a Luanne costume and mask to recieve an official AudreyV.u.c.a The Dark lane trading card with one of the 4 characters :)
